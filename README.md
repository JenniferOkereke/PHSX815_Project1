# PHSX815_Project1
This repository will contain my first project on computational physics
This is a python script that performs an experiment to determine whether the bank has more customers on tuesdays than any other days of the week. the script uses data from a text file and the poisson distribution to compute the likelihoods of two hypothesis and make a decision based on the comparison of the likelihoods.
     this script requires the following package 
     numpy
     matplotlib
     scipy
       usage
    To run this script,follow these steps;
    Make sure that the required packages are installed in your python environment
    download the bank.data.txt file and save it in the same directory as the script 
    open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the script and the data file are located.
    run the script with the following command 
    
    Python3 BankAnalysis.py
    then to get the script write the result to a textfile 
    type python3 Bank_Tuesdays.txt
    typoe python3 Bank_Otherdays.txt
    same is applicable for the both scenario.
    By default,the script will also write the results to a text file named ........ in the same directory.
